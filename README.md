# Analysis of Neural Networks. Applications to Interpretability and Uncertainty | Code
<br/>

This repository contains the code implemented for the Final Project ```Analysis of Neural Networks. Applications to Interpretability and Uncertainty```. The code has been written in ```Python``` and is divided in different ```Jupyter Notebooks```.

### Requirements
This repository contains a file named ```environment.yml``` with the ```tfg``` environment, which includes all required packages:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tfg
```
The library used to implement the neural networks is [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
The library used to implement the interpretability algorithms is [captum](https://github.com/pytorch/captum).
### Notebooks
Here is the list of notebooks containing the code:
- ```classification_circles.ipynb```:
- ```classification_segment.ipynb```:
- ```timeseries_autoencoder.ipynb```:
- ```interpretability.ipynb```:
- ```uncertainty.ipynb```:


### Images
